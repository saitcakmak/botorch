title: BoTorch Tutorials
---
The tutorials here will help you understand and use BoTorch in
your own work. They assume that you are familiar with both
Bayesian optimization (BO) and PyTorch.

If you are new to BO, we recommend you start with the
[Ax docs](https://ax.dev/docs/bayesopt) and the
following
[tutorial paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811).

If you are new to PyTorch, the easiest way to get started is
with the [What is PyTorch?](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-tensor-tutorial-py)
tutorial.

The BoTorch tutorials are grouped into the following four areas.


<h4>Using BoTorch with Ax</h4>
These tutorials give you an overview of how to leverage
[Ax](https://ax.dev), a platform for sequential
experimentation, in order to simplify the management of your BO
loop. Doing so can help you focus on the main aspects of BO
(models, acquisition functions, optimization of acquisition
functions), rather than tedious loop control. See our
[Documentation](/docs/botorch_and_ax)
for additional information.

<h4>Full Optimization Loops</h4>
In some situations (e.g. when working in a non-standard setting,
or if you want to understand and control various details of the
BO loop), then you may also consider working purely in BoTorch.
The tutorials in this section illustrate this approach.

<h4>Bite-Sized Tutorials</h4>
Rather than guiding you through full end-to-end BO loops, the
tutorials in this section focus on specific tasks that you will
encounter in customizing your BO algorithms. For instance, you
may want to
[write a custom acquisition function](/docs/tutorials/custom_acquisition)
and then
[use a custom zero-th order optimizer](/docs/tutorials/optimize_with_cmaes)
to optimize it.

<h4>Advanced Usage</h4>
Tutorials in this section showcase more advanced ways of using
BoTorch. For instance,
[this tutorial](/docs/tutorials/vae_mnist)
shows how to perform BO if your objective function is an image,
by optimizing in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder
(VAE).
