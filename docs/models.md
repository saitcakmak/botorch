title: Models

Models play an essential role in Bayesian Optimization (BO). A model is used as
a surrogate function for the actual underlying black box function to be
optimized. In BoTorch, a `Model` maps a set of design points to a posterior
probability distribution of its output(s) over the design points.

In BO, the model used is traditionally a Gaussian Process (GP), in which case
the posterior distribution is a multivariate normal. While BoTorch supports many
GP models, **BoTorch makes no assumption on the model being a GP** or the
posterior being multivariate normal. With the exception of some of the analytic
acquisition functions in the
[`botorch.acquisition.analytic`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/acquisition.html#analytic-acquisition-function-api)
module, BoTorch’s Monte Carlo-based acquisition functions are compatible with
any model that conforms to the `Model` interface, whether user-implemented or
provided.

Under the hood, BoTorch models are PyTorch `Modules` that implement the
light-weight [`Model`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#model-apis) interface. When working
with GPs,
[`GPyTorchModel`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#module-botorch.models.gp_regression)
provides a base class for conveniently wrapping GPyTorch models.

Users can extend `Model` and `GPyTorchModel` to generate their own models. For
more on implementing your own models, see
[Implementing Custom Models](#implementing-custom-models) below.

## Terminology

### Multi-Output and Multi-Task

A `Model` (as in the BoTorch object) may have multiple outputs, multiple inputs,
and may exploit correlation between different inputs. BoTorch uses the following
terminology to distinguish these model types:

- _Multi-Output Model_: a `Model` with multiple outputs. Most BoTorch `Model`s
  are multi-output.
- _Multi-Task Model_: a `Model` making use of a logical grouping of
  inputs/observations (as in the underlying process). For example, there could
  be multiple tasks where each task has a different fidelity. In a multi-task
  model, the relationship between different outputs is modeled, with a joint
  model across tasks.

Note the following:

- A multi-task (MT) model may or may not be a multi-output model. For example,
  if a multi-task model uses different tasks for modeling but only outputs
  predictions for one of those tasks, it is single-output.
- Conversely, a multi-output (MO) model may or may not be a multi-task model.
  For example, multi-output `Model`s that model different outputs independently
  rather than building a joint model are not multi-task.
- If a model is both, we refer to it as a multi-task-multi-output (MTMO) model.

### Noise: Homoskedastic, fixed, and heteroskedastic

Noise can be treated in several different ways:

- _Homoskedastic_: Noise is not provided as an input and is inferred, with a
  constant variance that does not depend on `X`. Many models, such as
  `SingleTaskGP`, take this approach. Use these models if you know that your
  observations are noisy, but not how noisy.

- _Fixed_: Noise is provided as an input, `train_Yvar`, and is not fit. In
  “fixed noise” models like `SingleTaskGP` with noise observations, noise cannot
  be predicted out-of-sample because it has not been modeled. Use these models
  if you have estimates of the noise in your observations (e.g. observations may
  be averages over individual samples in which case you would provide the mean
  as observation and the standard error of the mean as the noise estimate), or
  if you know your observations are noiseless (by passing a zero noise level).

- _Heteroskedastic_: Noise is provided as an input and is modeled to allow for
  predicting noise out-of-sample. BoTorch does not implement a model that
  supports this out of the box.

## Standard BoTorch Models

BoTorch provides several GPyTorch models to cover most standard BO use cases:

### Single-Task GPs

These models use the same training data for all outputs and assume conditional
independence of the outputs given the input. If different training data is
required for each output, use a
[`ModelListGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#module-botorch.models.model_list_gp_regression)
instead.

- [`SingleTaskGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.gp_regression.SingleTaskGP):
  a single-task exact GP that supports both inferred and observed noise. When
  noise observations are not provided, it infers a homoskedastic noise level.
- [`MixedSingleTaskGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.gp_regression_mixed.MixedSingleTaskGP):
  a single-task exact GP that supports mixed search spaces, which combine
  discrete and continuous features.
- [`SaasFullyBayesianSingleTaskGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.fully_bayesian.SaasFullyBayesianSingleTaskGP):
  a fully Bayesian single-task GP with the SAAS prior. This model is suitable
  for sample-efficient high-dimensional Bayesian optimization.

### Model List of Single-Task GPs

- [`ModelListGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#module-botorch.models.model_list_gp_regression):
  A multi-output model in which outcomes are modeled independently, given a list
  of any type of single-task GP. This model should be used when the same
  training data is not used for all outputs.

### Multi-Task GPs

- [`MultiTaskGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#module-botorch.models.multitask): a
  Hadamard multi-task, multi-output GP using an ICM kernel. Supports both known
  observation noise levels and inferring a homoskedastic noise level (when noise
  observations are not provided).
- [`KroneckerMultiTaskGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.multitask.KroneckerMultiTaskGP):
  A multi-task, multi-output GP using an ICM kernel, with Kronecker structure.
  Useful for multi-fidelity optimization.
- [`SaasFullyBayesianMultiTaskGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.fully_bayesian_multitask.SaasFullyBayesianMultiTaskGP):
  a fully Bayesian multi-task GP using an ICM kernel. The data kernel uses the
  SAAS prior to model high-dimensional parameter spaces.

All of the above models use RBF kernels with Automatic Relevance Discovery
(ARD), and have reasonable priors on hyperparameters that make them work well in
settings where the **input features are normalized to the unit cube** and the
**observations are standardized** (zero mean, unit variance). The lengthscale
priors scale with the input dimension, which makes them adaptable to both low
and high dimensional problems. See
[this discussion](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/discussions/2451) for
additional context on the default hyperparameters.

## Other useful models

- [`ModelList`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.model.ModelList): a
  multi-output model container in which outcomes are modeled independently by
  individual `Model`s (as in `ModelListGP`, but the component models do not all
  need to be GPyTorch models).
- [`SingleTaskMultiFidelityGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.gp_regression_fidelity.SingleTaskMultiFidelityGP):
  A GP model for multi-fidelity optimization. For more on Multi-Fidelity BO, see
  the [tutorial](tutorials/discrete_multi_fidelity_bo).
- [`HigherOrderGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.higher_order_gp.HigherOrderGP):
  A GP model with matrix-valued predictions, such as images or grids of images.
- [`PairwiseGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#module-botorch.models.pairwise_gp): A
  probit-likelihood GP that learns via pairwise comparison data, useful for
  preference learning.
- [`ApproximateGPyTorchModel`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.approximate_gp.ApproximateGPyTorchModel):
  for efficient computation when data is large or responses are non-Gaussian.
- [Deterministic models](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#module-botorch.models.deterministic),
  such as
  [`AffineDeterministicModel`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.deterministic.AffineDeterministicModel),
  [`AffineFidelityCostModel`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.cost.AffineFidelityCostModel),
  [`GenericDeterministicModel`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.deterministic.GenericDeterministicModel),
  and
  [`PosteriorMeanModel`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.deterministic.PosteriorMeanModel)
  express known input-output relationships; they conform to the BoTorch `Model`
  API, so they can easily be used in conjunction with other BoTorch models.
  Deterministic models are useful for multi-objective optimization with known
  objective functions and for encoding cost functions for cost-aware
  acquisition.
- [`SingleTaskVariationalGP`](https://botorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html#botorch.models.approximate_gp.SingleTaskVariationalGP):
  an approximate model for faster computation when you have a lot of data or
  your responses are non-Gaussian.

## Implementing Custom Models

The configurability of the above models is limited (for instance, it is not
straightforward to use a different kernel). Doing so is an intentional design
decision -- we believe that having a few simple and easy-to-understand models
for basic use cases is more valuable than having a highly complex and
configurable model class whose implementation is difficult to understand.

Instead, we advocate that users implement their own models to cover more
specialized use cases. The light-weight nature of BoTorch's Model API makes this
easy to do. See the
[Using a custom BoTorch model in Ax](tutorials/custom_botorch_model_in_ax)
tutorial for an example.

The BoTorch `Model` interface is light-weight and easy to extend. The only
requirement for using BoTorch's Monte-Carlo based acquisition functions is that
the model has a `posterior` method. It takes in a Tensor `X` of design points,
and returns a Posterior object describing the (joint) probability distribution
of the model output(s) over the design points in `X`. The `Posterior` object
must implement an `rsample()` method for sampling from the posterior of the
model. If you wish to use gradient-based optimization algorithms, the model
should allow back-propagating gradients through the samples to the model input.

If you happen to implement a model that would be useful for other researchers as
well (and involves more than just swapping out the RBF kernel for a Matérn
kernel), please consider [contributing](getting_started#contributing) this model
to BoTorch.
